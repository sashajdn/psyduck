# Plan

1. Validate add / mul on Nvidia GPU via rust
2. Get running on CPU level
    a) naive
    b) with SIMD / striding (need to understand why striding doesn't solve the problem in full)
    c) gather charts to find saturation point
3. Move to GPU implementation of matmul
4. Once saturated, impl KvCache
